## The Project

DISTRHO is an open-source project that provides Cross-Platform Audio Plugins.

Our main target platform is Linux, but we support Windows and Mac too.

Our entire source code is available in GitHub: <https://github.com/DISTRHO/>

Third parties are welcome to share their code with us if they want to see a Linux port.
Contact the project leader, falkTX, if you're interested on this.
