Standalone versions of the Arctican and TAL Plugins ports are now available.
They are useful if your favourite host does not support VST plugins yet.
They are also useful for packaging into distributions because they don't require
any restricted code to build (like the VST-SDK).
These standalone versions can work with ALSA or JACK.
