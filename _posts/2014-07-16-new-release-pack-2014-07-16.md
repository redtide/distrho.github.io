In this release we cleaned up all the plugins, added new ones and removed those
that we not considered good enough.\
Standalones are no longer available.
Highlife was removed as a requested by its authors.

The plugins we added to Ports are:
- Dexed
- KlangFalter
- MVerb
- Nekobi
- Obxd
- PitchedDelay

Additionally we made a new plugin - ProM - a music visualizer as audio plugin based on projectm.
