Studio quality, open-source reverb. Its release was intended to provide
a practical demonstration of Dattorroâ€™s figure-of-eight reverb structure
and provide the open source community with a high quality reverb.

This is a DPF'ied build of [MVerb], allowing a proper Linux version with UI.
LADSPA, DSSI, LV2, VST2 and VST3 plugin versions can be built, plus a JACK-Standalone.
