CHOW is a digital ditortion effect designed for maximum truculence, somewhere
between a true half-wave rectifier and a noisy vintage compressor. Useful for
mixing guitars, drums, even vocals when a heavily degraded sound is desired.
Feel free to build and use for your own enjoyment!

CHOW is currently available in the following formats:
- VST
- VST3
- AU
- Standalone plugin
