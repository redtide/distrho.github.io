ReFine is a plugin that allows to add a final polishing to your tracks,
busses and masters.
It extracts psycho-acoustic parameters from the source and thus allows to add warmth,
space and punch to your mixes.
This is done level dependent and rather subtle;
you probably won't be able to create heavy distortion effects with this plugin.
