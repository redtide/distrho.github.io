[DISTRHO] is an open-source project for Cross-Platform Audio Plugins.

The project is splitted into 3 main categories:

- [DPF-Plugins]:
    Plugins made with our own plugin framework, either created by us
    or ports of existing plugins to DPF style.
    Typically available as LV2, VST2 and VST3, with LADSPA and DSSI as well where possible.

- [DIE-Plugins]:
    Plugins imported into the DISTRHO project for easy packaging.
    Imported plugins have their LV2 bundle and URIs renamed,
    in order to make them compatible with the originals.
    Currently only available as LV2.

- [DISTRHO-Ports]:
    JUCE-based plugins ported to Linux and LV2,
    also available as VST2 and sometimes VST3.

## PawPaw

[PawPaw] is a Cross-Platform build scripts setup for static libraries and audio plugins.
It was created out of the need of many open-source developers
to easily build their stuff for macOS and Windows,
where usually dependencies are involved which need to be built manually.

## Get them all

Everything we release is free and open-source.
You can find the source code for all the plugins, ports, PawPaw
and even [this website] there.
